## Database Schema

### Educational Concepts Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE educational_concepts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    concept_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    difficulty_level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    short_description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    detailed_explanation TEXT NOT NULL,
    practical_example TEXT,
    formula VARCHAR(200),
    interpretation_guide TEXT,
    common_mistakes TEXT,
    keywords VARCHAR(500),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

### Learning Progress Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_learning_progress (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    concept_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    completion_date DATETIME,
    difficulty_rating INTEGER,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

## Default Educational Content

The system initializes with comprehensive educational content including:

### Technical Indicators
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Moving Averages (SMA/EMA)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

### Fundamental Ratios
- P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)
- ROE (Return on Equity)

### Market Concepts
- Market Capitalization
- Sector Analysis
- Risk Management

Each concept includes:
- Clear explanations in simple language
- Practical examples with real stock scenarios
- Mathematical formulas where applicable
- Common mistakes and interpretation guides
- Related concept suggestions

## API Integration

### Request/Response Examples

**Search Concepts:**
```http
GET /api/v1/education/concepts/search?query=RSI&difficulty_level=beginner
```

**Get Explanation:**
```http
POST /api/v1/education/explain
{
    "concept_name": "RSI",
    "context": "AAPL analysis",
    "user_level": "beginner"
}
```

**Track Progress:**
```http
POST /api/v1/education/progress/1?completed=true&difficulty_rating=4
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for `EducationService` functionality
- API endpoint tests with mocked dependencies
- Chat integration tests for educational features
- Frontend component tests (planned)

### Test Files Created
- `test_education_service.py`: Core service functionality tests
- `test_education_api.py`: API endpoint tests
- `test_chat_education_integration.py`: Chat integration tests

## Requirements Fulfilled
